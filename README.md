# twitch tui chat thing

## TODO

- [ ] Rework how rendering works
      Probably follow the "chat" example from [Bubbletea examples](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master/examples/chat)
      Not sure how to combine it with real-time updates, but life finds a way.
- [x] Add a way to change channels
- [x] Manage multiple channels at the same time (tabs?)
- [ ] Store chat logs?
- [x] Allow for further scrolling
- [ ] Add authentication feature
- [ ] Add a way to send messages
